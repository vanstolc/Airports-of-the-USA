# Airports of the United States

##  Functionality

This map displays US airports with and without control towers. When the viewer clicks on the airport icons, the name of the town containing the airport appears. These airports are underlain by a chloropleth map using shades of blue to indicate the approximate number of airports in each state. Additionally, a number appears in each state indicating the exact number of airports.
